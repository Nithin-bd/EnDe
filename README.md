# AES File Encryption and Decryption using Java Swings

This project can be used as a Java applet. It encrypts and decrypts files within the same folder location using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256, which is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 256-bit key to convert your plain text or data into a cipher.
